I love to solve complex problems using patterns/trends based on data. I also enjoy visualizing these insights into reports and dashboards that are easy to use and understand.

In my free time, I love to learn new technologies and programs that can further build my skills in this field. I am always looking for opportunities to expand my knowledge and skills. Whether working with a team or independently, I am driven to solve complex problems and discover new and valuable insights.
